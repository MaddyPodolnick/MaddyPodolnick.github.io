   The process for this album genuinely happened by accident. When the world shut down last year, I had a lot of time to reflect on my youth and the person I had been, who I have become and who I wanted to be. It just so happens that the best way for me to face those things and process my thoughts is by writing songs.

I am in a constant pursuit of bettering myself and always trying to become a better artist, songwriter, musician and human. A huge goal was to have the sonics of the album reflect the feeling of the emotions that I was immersed in when writing.
